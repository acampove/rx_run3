# v1

Jobs meant to filter data for `v1r3944`. Which was refitted and momentum scaled
These jobs were sent on October 6th 2025 alongside version `v1` of RKstar

# v2

These jobs are used to process 

- Data after track refitting and momentum correction
- MC with sim10f, resonant mode samples requested by rjpsi, semileptonic, etc

# v3

Second production of MC with sim10f. These samples are MC only and mostly to model
the rare mode, both signal and backgrounds.
