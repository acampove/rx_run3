These are config files needed to make ntuples with RapidSim

**v1** : Used for fits
**v2** : Adding:
        - Bs to phi to KK ee ntuples
        - electron Jpsi resonant mode, for MVA optimization
**v3** : Rename ks -> kst to make sure the naming is consistent
with what is in rx_common/types. Also ks can be confused with KShort
